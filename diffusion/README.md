# Generative_Diffusion_Models
The Diffusion Model has been implemented.

The results on 64*64 image resolution were released. The training dataset is CelebA-HQ dataset.
You can train this model on your own dataset by changing your dataset directory in config.py. 
Moreover, if you have high computation power you may need to increase the resolution in config.py. Here, I used UNET Architecture, feel free to change based on your own interest.



 For training please run the train.py file but for the testing, once you finished the training, change the checkpoint address in the test.py file, and test your model.
