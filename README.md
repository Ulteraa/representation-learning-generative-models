# Representation Learning & Generative Models

Consolidated research prototype implementations developed, exploring generative modeling paradigms including adversarial training (GAN, WGAN-GP), conditional image translation, diffusion models, super-resolution, and differentiable rendering.

This repository organizes experimental implementations under a unified structure for clarity and reference.
